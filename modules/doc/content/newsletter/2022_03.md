## MOOSE Improvements

### C++17 Support

MOOSE now requires a C++17 capable compiler and supports C++17 features. With this, GCC 7 and Clang 5 are now the minimum supported compilers.

## libMesh-level Changes

### `2022.03.16` Update

- Update MetaPhysicL
  - Add ValueType for `std::array`, `std::vector`
  - Implement `ReplaceAlgebraicType`
  - Add tolerance to `DynamicSparseNumberBase::sparsity_trim`
  - Simplify end/begin/rend/rbegin
  - When we exceed our `DynamicStdArray` wrapper container size, we'll throw
- Make `DynamicStdArrayWrapper` member protected
- Factor out push_node, respect offset
- Allow proper constness for our MeshBase iterators
- `libmesh_not_implemented()` in all unimplemented `TypeNTensor` functions
- README: branching description, devel Civet badge
- memcpy warning fix in `TypeNTensor`
- `Poly2Tri` refinement fixes

### `2022.03.02` Update

- Work towards source code compatibility with Windows
- Add an additional `outer_product` definition that supports `scalar * vector -> vector`
- Add auto-detection for PETSc external packages, notably HDF5
- Add internal thread safety within `NumericVector` subclasses
- Add initial support for `Poly2Tri` triangulations and refactor `TriangulatorInterface`
- Optimize `InfFE::reinit` when not all data has been requested
- Support the matrix-free case when computing the residual and Jacobian together
- Add more robust `Packing` for communication of fixed-size classes win variable-size containers
- Enable setting PETSc mat/vec types at runtime for future GPU use
- Require C++17 support and begin using it internally
- Add new static `TensorValue::rotation_matrix` helper functions

## PETSc-level Changes

PETSc has been updated to the 3.16.5 release. This release should have performance
improvements and better infrastructure support, but much of the update is transparent
to MOOSE users. The detailed PETSc release notes can be found at [the PETSc website](https://petsc.org/release/docs/changes/316/).

Changes that may be interesting to MOOSE users include the following:  
- Added PCQR - an interface to SuiteSparse QR factorization, which is a direct
  solver. This can be triggered in MOOSE using the `-pc_type qr` option.
- PETSc has better GPU support via native solver options like GAMG, or other third-party
  solver options such as HYPRE. The enhanced GPU capability can be triggered in
  MOOSE via the `-mat_type aijcusparse -vec_type cuda` command line option. Note
  that GPU capability is still experimental in MOOSE, and only algebra solver
  operations are available on GPUs. Residual and Jacobian evaluations are not
  available on GPUs yet. If you want to have meaningful performance improvement,
  you have to explore many problem-dependent PETSc options.
